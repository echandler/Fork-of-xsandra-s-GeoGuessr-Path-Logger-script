# Fork of xsandra's GeoGuessr Path Logger script

This an attempt to fix some bugs and update a classic GeoGuessr user script.

[Click here to install](https://github.com/echandler/Fork-of-xsandra-s-GeoGuessr-Path-Logger-script/raw/main/geoGuessrPathLoggerXsandraFork.user.js). If that didn't work, copy the contents of the user.js file into a new tampermonkey script.

Original script by xsandra can be found here => https://openuserjs.org/scripts/xsanda/GeoGuessr_Path_Logger
